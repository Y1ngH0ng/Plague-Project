            <h1>Source list from Project</h1>
            <p> If you have not yet seen it on the other pages. These are the sources that we have used for all aspects of this project.The parish registers consited of <a href="https://archive.org/details/registerofallchr01stpe/page/216/mode/2up">St Peter Cornhill</a>, <a href="https://archive.org/details/registersofstpau36stpa/page/32/mode/2up
                        ">St Paul Covent Garden</a>, <a href="https://archive.org/details/parishregisterof16kens/page/132/mode/2up"
                            >Kensington-Middlesex</a>, <a href="https://archive.org/details/registerbookofpa00lond/page/50/mode/2up">St Christopher Stocks </a>, <a href="https://archive.org/details/registerbookpar00pargoog/page/n128/mode/2up">St Nicholas-Acons</a>.  The Bills of Mortality were found <a href="https://wellcomecollection.org/works/bqxkq9yy/items">here</a>. 
                With these data points we worked to build the pages and mapes you see on the site. If you would like to see a normal map of these labeled parishes here is a link to the <a href="https://www.british-history.ac.uk/london-record-soc/vol32/pp2-3">British History Online map</a>. These were the sources used and consulted when building the graphs and data for this project. 
                If you would like direct access to any of the materials directly I would reccomend going to our <a href="https://github.com/Y1ngH0ng/Plague-Project">Github</a> under the xml and map folder.

        <h1>Future Research and Other Potential Sources</h1>
            
            <p> To begin this section we should discuss aspects of future research. The data we have collected and is held in the links below could be used to more broadly look at potential plague deaths undercount.
                This is largely because the records kept at individual parishes do not align with the data found in the Bills of Mortality even with the small sample size we have. This could be used to further look at this question and get a more steady conclusion than we get.
                Another cheif area of expanded research could be in mapping the people who died in the parish registers. In each of the registers there is a record of the names of those who died. A study could be conducted with network graphs to show how many families or relatives were killed. This could track spread or impact on specfic people (assuming other documentation can cooberate the stories).
                The last potential research reccomendation could be expanding upon the mapping we have done and making it more interactive and include it in an analysis of the spread of plague from Weeks 33-47. This could see if spread in a perdictible patterns inline with modern version of the pathogen.

                The following list is of potential sources that can be added onto the existing materials we have compiled. Notes of the source are provided by Dr. William Campbell and inform what each source contains in terms of relevant data. Those that include causes are labled and those that do not are unlabeled. The links are from <a href="https://harleian.org.uk/Volumes.htm">Harleian Society</a> has listed as available online and the others can be found through Inter-Library-Lone (these are labeled ILL).
