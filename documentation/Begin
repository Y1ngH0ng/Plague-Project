The scope of this project is to look at the london regin durng the years of 1664 - 1666 to look at the number of death report to be casued by the plague. 
With this data we hope to create a heat map that shows the parishes and number of deaths and what the out breakouts looked like.
We intend to use the data to look for under reporting  of the out breakout along with see how the plague would have spread from parish to parish and look at possible geolical reason for the spread.
We also want to highlight how different econmic backgrouds could have been effecting spread and duration off the deasease.

In first begining mark up of the Parishes with death records we are covering 1664-1666 to gain a good idea at how much the plague affected the parishes.
Addtionally, we are only recording name, death date, and type of death, we are not tracking relation due to project limitations. -Trenton
