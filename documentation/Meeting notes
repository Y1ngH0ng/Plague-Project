We dedied to each take one of the parishes and market up the time between start of 1664 to the end 1666.
We select five parishes to markup for daily mortality data from the time period we are investigating. By utilizing these parishes in a closer view, we can gain more in-depth data, not only for months but also for days and their geographical location. 
The parishes that we marked up for this are St Peter's Cornhill, St Christopher Stocks, Kensington Middlesex, St Paul Covent Garden, and St Nicholas Acons.
We wanted have the dates of each day of these parishes to look closer and make a map of them and possible use them to see prodiction maping.
