        <p>These are maps we have made out of shape files from the  Layers of London - Institute of Historical Research, University of London, and Museum of London Archaeology. They were extracted with the help of  Boris Michev of Pitt's University Library Digital Services by uploading the shapefiles to ArcGIS Pro and exporting the data as a .csv.
