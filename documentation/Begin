The scope of this project is to look at the london regin durng the years of 1664 - 1666 to look at the number of death report to be casued by the plague. 
With this data we hope to create a heat map that shows the parishes and number of deaths and what the out breakouts looked like.
We intend to use the data to look for under report of the out breakout along with see how the plague would have spread from parish to parish and look at geolical reason for the spread.
We also want to highlight how different econmic backgrouds could have been effecting spread and duration off the deasease.
