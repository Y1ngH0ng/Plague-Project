           <h1>The Data Hub</h1> 
            
           <p> This part of the website is home to all of the data visualizations we have made for both the parish registers and the Bills of Mortality (both links can be found in the about page). 
               The Week-by Week pages are filled with the plague deaths of every parish that week (found in a table form) and a graph showing deaths and burials. Access to these data pages can be clicking the week by week tab found in red.</p>
            
            <p>The other tab labeled (put a name here) is where you can find the month to month death data from the parishes of  <a href="https://archive.org/details/registerofallchr01stpe/page/216/mode/2up">St Peter Cornhill</a>, <a href="https://archive.org/details/registersofstpau36stpa/page/32/mode/2up
                ">St Paul Covent Garden</a>, <a href="https://archive.org/details/parishregisterof16kens/page/132/mode/2up"
                    >Kensington-Middlesex</a>, <a href="https://archive.org/details/registerbookofpa00lond/page/50/mode/2up">St Christopher Stocks </a>, <a href="https://archive.org/details/registerbookpar00pargoog/page/n128/mode/2up">St Nicholas-Acons</a>. These are assembeled from the data and are labeled x where no cause is given and plag where there are plague deaths.
            The forms which are found on our github also have the names and exact dates of the recorded deaths. A note on Kensington Middlesex is that it is the county around London and is reflective of the wider area.</p>
