            This part of the website is home to all of the data visualizations we have made for both the parish registers and the Bills of Mortality (both links can be found in the about page). 
            The Week-by Week pages are filled with the plague deaths of every parish that week (found in a table form) and a graph showing deaths and burials. Access to these data pages can be clicking the week by week tab.
