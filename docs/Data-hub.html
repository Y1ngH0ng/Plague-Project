           <h1>The Data Hub</h1> 
            
           <p> This part of the website is home to all of the data visualizations we have made for both the parish registers and the Bills of Mortality (both links can be found in the about page). 
               The Week-by Week pages are filled with the plague deaths of every parish that week (found in a table form) and a graph showing deaths and burials. Access to these data pages can be clicking the week by week tab found in red.</p>
            
            <p>The other tab labeled Parish Death Graphs from 1664-1666 is where you can find the month to month death data from the parishes of  <a href="https://archive.org/details/registerofallchr01stpe/page/216/mode/2up">St Peter Cornhill</a>, <a href="https://archive.org/details/registersofstpau36stpa/page/32/mode/2up
                ">St Paul Covent Garden</a>, <a href="https://archive.org/details/parishregisterof16kens/page/132/mode/2up"
                    >Kensington-Middlesex</a>, <a href="https://archive.org/details/registerbookofpa00lond/page/50/mode/2up">St Christopher Stocks </a>, <a href="https://archive.org/details/registerbookpar00pargoog/page/n128/mode/2up">St Nicholas-Acons</a>. These are assembeled from the data and are labeled unspecified where no cause is given and plague where there are plague deaths.
            The forms which are found on our github also have the names and exact dates of the recorded deaths. A note on Kensington Middlesex is that it is the county around London and is reflective of the wider area.</p>
            
            <h1>General Analysis</h1>
            
            <p>Between the Data and Bills Of Mortality we can observe the counts to see where different parishes have some form of observable under count of plague deaths.
            In order to get the Parish data the parishes hired individuals to collect go around and count dead bodies. However, one of things we noticed when inputing data was that when a mother died of plague their children shortly died after and were marked as having died of unknown cause.
            This although convinving does not mean the children did not die of something else, perhaps parental neglect. However, when we further observed the numbers we noticed some under count of number present in a few areas of the data. The examples I present are some early findings.</p>
            
            <p>When looking at St. Paul Covent we see some of the worst exaple of undercount. When looking at the months of July, August, and September (the begining of the plague to it's mid point) we see the following; <b>In July in the Bills there were 24 deaths recorded and in the Registers there were 15 deaths, In August in the Bills there were 60 deaths recorded and in the Registers there were 44 deaths, In September in the Bills there were 123 deaths recorded and in the Registers there were 100 deaths. </b>
                The reasons for this undercount are unclear but some reasons are mentioned above. This parish is also the place where we see the worst under count.</p>
            
                <p>When looking St Peter Cornhill the numbers are more aligned but there is still some differences. When looking at the same Months of July, August, and September we see the following; <b>In July in the Bills there were 7 deaths recorded and in the Registers there were 7 deaths, In August in the Bills there were 16 deaths and in the Registers there were 17 deaths, In September in the Bills there were 25 deaths and the Registers had 20 deaths.</b>
                Here there is less undercount and we see numbers that align more. The differences can be chalked up to similar reasons as above, although with differences this small we could also theorize that the counters missed some people.</p>
                
                <p>The last Parish we looked at was St Nicholas Acons where we see the numbers even more similar to each other. When looking at the same months of July, August, and September we see the following; <b>In July in the Bills there was 1 death recorded and in the Registers there were 0 deaths, In August in the Bills there was 1 death and in the Registers there was 1 death, In September in the Bills there were 17 deaths and the registets had 16.</b>
                Here is by far the best in terms of undercount wheew the numbers are much closer across all 3 months in comparison to the other two parishes.</p>
                
                <h2>General Conclusions</h2>
                We see in the early data that there is some real undercount in some of the parishes. Depending on the area it is clear that the numbers are undercounted more than others. 
                What the reasons are we cannot percisely conclude, however some evidence would point to those who collected the data, or misapropriation of cause of death. It is hard to make a firm claim, but we could encourage others to further follow this line of analysis and investigation.
