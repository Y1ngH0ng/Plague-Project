From Dr. Campbell, 2/14/25:

Weekly Bills of Mortality (52)
Source for 1665 Bills of Mortality: https://wellcomecollection.org/works/bqxkq9yy/items
The XML is done but needs to be checked for errors.

Annual Bills of Mortality (2: 1665 was done, 1666 was not)

1665: https://wellcomecollection.org/works/bqxkq9yy/items?canvas=116
1666: https://wellcomecollection.org/works/bqxkq9yy/items?canvas=119
For the the year-end Bills , use the template Bills-Mortality-year-16xx.xml, which should be in the London's Dreadful Visitation repo.


Parish Registers including causes of death

Burial registers of certain parish churches survive and can be used to augment and double-check the Bills of Mortality data. It could also be interesting to see the effect of the plague on the numbers of baptisms (which would correlate to the birthrate) and marriages by comparing them to longer-term averages as seen in these parishes.

The XML form to use for these is Parish-name-register-with-causes.xml
