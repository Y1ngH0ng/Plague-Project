            <p>
                The goal of our project is to compile death records from London parishes into a single database. This will help us trace how quickly the plague spread. We’re also exploring signs of underreported plague deaths by comparing months with high overall mortality but fewer recorded plague cases.

            <h2>Part 1: Project Beginnings and Summary</h2>
            <p>
                The project was originally conceived by Dr. Campbell (our faculty member) as a way to map and track plague deaths in London during the Great Plague in 1665. Each team member expressed interest and was selected by Dr. Campbell to be a part of the project. These projects were started as proposals and were shaped by time and group decisions. The data from the Bills of Mortality was entered by Dr. Campbell’s World History to 1500 students and was checked using an XQuery from the project team. The parish registry data was gathered by the project team and input on forms provided by Dr. Campbell.

            <h2>Part 2: Code Used and Choices of Scope</h2>
            
            <h3>Parish Registers</h3>
            <p>
                During this Spring term, we decided to collect data on only 5 Parishes due to a time constraint of 16 weeks. The Bills of Mortality from London’s <i>Dreadful Visitation</i> had already been done, but had to be checked for accuracy.
                Each team member was assigned one Parish to complete, with the remaining being done by another member of the team. For the Parishes, we collected the name of the person who died, the date, and the cause. Those who were given a cause were listed with an X. Names were left as represented in the Parish Registers, and causes were noted when given (they rarely are). The Parish registers completed were 
                <a href="https://archive.org/details/registerofallchr01stpe/page/216/mode/2up">St Peter Cornhill</a>, 
                <a href="https://archive.org/details/registersofstpau36stpa/page/32/mode/2up">St Paul Covent Garden</a>, 
                <a href="https://archive.org/details/parishregisterof16kens/page/132/mode/2up">Kensington-Middlesex</a>, 
                <a href="https://archive.org/details/registerbookofpa00lond/page/50/mode/2up">St Christopher Stocks</a>, and 
                <a href="https://archive.org/details/registerbookpar00pargoog/page/n128/mode/2up">St Nicholas-Acons</a> from 1664 to August 1666.
                These were pulled from the Internet Archive. The Scalable Vector Graphic made for these was done by RJ and Josiah and measures the plague deaths per parish on a month-by-month basis. Using this, we can compare with the Bills of Mortality to see any issues with the undercount of deaths in the parishes.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Bills of Mortality</h3>
            <p>
                The Bills of Mortality were done by students in the World History to 1500 class as homework assignments and were checked by Trenton by hand with XQuery written to help check the totals. When these were aligned, an XQuery was built to form an HTML table that was later converted into a CSV file, and another to make week-by-week data pages for every week. Alex and Trenton split the role of making these pages. These pages can be seen under the data page.
                The next step was making heat maps of the spread of plague across the parishes of London. We used shape files that Dr. Campbell obtained from Layers of London, Institute of Historical Research, and Museum of London Archaeology. These files were converted into a CSV by Boris Michev of Pitt's Library Digital Services. We matched names from the 1676 map to 1665 data—out of around 125, we matched 118. Trenton then used ARCGIS to make the first set of maps for plague deaths per parish from week 25–52. Alex made the map set that tracked plague deaths as a percentage of total burials.

            <p>We hope that you enjoy seeing the data from these sources visualized in new modern forms!</p>
