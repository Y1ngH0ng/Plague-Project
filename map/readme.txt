The file Parishes.csv was extracted from the shapefile data by Boris Michev of Pitt's University Library Digital Services by uploading the shapefiles to ArcGIS Pro and exporting the data as a .csv. This is to allow the attribute values in any .csv created by the project to match up with the spellings of the parish names as used in the shapefiles.
